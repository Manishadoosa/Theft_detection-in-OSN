# Online Social Network Identity Theft Detection and Algorithm Guide

This repository contains research materials, documentation, and code for identifying identity theft in online social networks through composite behavioral modeling and various classification algorithms. 

## Contents

- **`Algorithms.docx`**: Contains information on various machine learning algorithms used in classification tasks, including:
  - Decision Trees
  - Gradient Boosting
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- **`Composite Behavioral Modeling for Identity Theft Detection in Online Social Networks.pdf`**: A comprehensive paper detailing the methodology and evaluation of composite behavioral modeling (CBM) for identity theft detection in online social networks. It includes:
  - An overview of identity theft in online environments.
  - Theoretical background on composite behavioral modeling.
  - Experimental setup and results on datasets such as Foursquare and Yelp.
  - Comparative analysis with other models such as CF-KDE, LDA, and fused models. 

## Key Highlights

1. **Algorithms for Detection**: 
   - Describes the structure and performance of various algorithms suitable for identity detection.
   - Details how each algorithm can be used in detecting unusual patterns or intrusions.

2. **Composite Behavioral Modeling**: 
   - Introduces a joint probabilistic model that integrates user behaviors across multiple dimensions (online and offline).
   - Uses Bayesian networks and Dirichlet distributions to identify outliers or abnormal behavior indicative of identity theft.

3. **Real-world Application**:
   - Utilizes data from real-world sources (Foursquare, Yelp) to validate model performance.
   - Achieves high detection accuracy, with an AUC score of up to 0.956 on certain datasets.
